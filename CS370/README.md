## Motion Sensor Using Raspberry Pi

This project focused on creating a practical and functional program using a Raspberry Pi and a sensor of choice. 

We decided to create a alternative solution to home security using motion sensors and a external camera. When motion was detected using the motion sensor, 
the device would automatically begin recording a 20 second video of the activity detected. Once recorded, the device would automatically send the video to 
a dropbox account set up by the consumer. There the consumer was able to view the videos and decide whether the activity was concerning or not and take further action.
