# Final Project for CS345 - Machine Learning Foundations and Practice

## Student Performance Analysis

The final project for CS345 asked for classification and regression model for a dataset found on UCI Dataset Repository. For this I decided to use [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).
With this dataset, I explored different Machine Learning techniques to analyze the data with the goal of consolidating my learning.
