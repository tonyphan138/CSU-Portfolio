# Final Project for JTC372 - Web Design and Development

## Website Created for HopePeakMedia as a final project for JTC372

In this project, I consolidate my learning of Web Design and Development by creating a website using only HTML and CSS. The website I created focused 
on responsive design and reducing load times. 

This website is not complete, as more content would be added as HopePeakMedia would like.
