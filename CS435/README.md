# Term Project for CS435 - Introduction to Big Data

## Movie Rating Analysis

In this project, we performed analysis on a large dataset using Big Data techniques to preprocess the data.

For preprocessing, we used Apache Spark using the Scala files to join the necessary tables and speed up calculating averages where needed. Once the data 
was reduced to a smaller size, we used python to perform analysis.
